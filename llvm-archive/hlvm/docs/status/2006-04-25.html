<h1>Status As Of April 25,2006</h1>
<p>HLVM is just getting started. The idea was generated from some discussion on
the LLVM IRC channel. There is much that needs to be done in order to get LLVM
fully coherent as a virtual machine. While LLVM provides the raw materials, HLVM
will provide the finished product.</p>
<p>Current, we have been collecting resources. As of today, we have:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Four interested developers</li>
  <li>Reserved hlvm.org domain name</li>
  <li>Brought up a Subversion repository for the code</li>
  <li>Built a <a href="/wiki/">wiki</a></li>
  <li>Built an introductory web site</li>
  <li>Discussed many ideas about what HLVM should be</li>
  <li>Documented some architecture and data flow in the wiki</li>
</ul>
