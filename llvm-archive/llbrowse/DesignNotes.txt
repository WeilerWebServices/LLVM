Coding Style: The rule for coding style shall be as follows:

   1) Use the LLVM style conventions for the most part.
   2) In cases where the LLVM conventions are ambiguous, inconsistent, or
      underspecified, use the wxWidgets conventions.
      
   In particular:
     *  80-column lines.
     *  Method names begin with an uppercase letter (wxWidgets convention).
     *  Pointer and reference types will be spelled Type* and Type& (space
        after the operator, not before.)
