* 0. Add "#include poolcheck.h" in the kernel pool allocator runtime 
1. You need to add statements corresponding to those within POOLCHECKINSERT macro in PoolAllocatorBitMask.cpp in to the kernel allocator
2. Replace malloc with kmalloc equivalent in poolcheck.cpp 
* 3. Do not allow the poolallocator to release memory to the system 
4. PoolCheck.cpp uses PageSize defined in PoolAllocatorBitMask.cpp , you need to adjust it to Slab Size in the kernel pool allocator
5. Add two functions to return splay tree and poolcheckslab in PoolAllocator.h

System functions/features that poolcheck library depends upon:

1. memory allocation function (malloc/kmalloc)
2. function to call if run-time checks fail
3. function to call if splay tree code fails
