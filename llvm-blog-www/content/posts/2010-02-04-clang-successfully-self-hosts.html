title: Clang Successfully Self-Hosts!
---

Today, Clang completed its first complete self-host! We built all of LLVM and Clang with Clang (over 550k lines of C++ code). The resulting binaries passed all of Clang and LLVM's regression test suites, and the Clang-built Clang could then build all of LLVM and Clang again. The third-stage Clang was also fully-functional, completing the bootstrap.<div><br /></div><div>Congratulations to all of the Clang developers on this amazing achievement!</div>
