title: LLVM receives first ever SIGPLAN Software Systems Award
---

Today the <a href="http://www.acm.org/press-room/news-releases/2010/sigplan-software-award/view">ACM announced</a> that Chris Lattner and the LLVM Project are the recipient of the <a href="http://www.sigplan.org/award-software.htm">Programming Languages Software Award</a>.<br /><br />This award recognizes the impact that LLVM has had on the compiler research community, which can be seen in the large number of <a href="http://llvm.org/pubs/">research publications using LLVM</a> and the number of compiler courses that are using LLVM to teach compiler construction and optimization techniques.  As part of this award, the ACM is donating $2500 to the LLVM project.
