title: LLVM in ClamAV
---

New in version 0.96, the ClamAV antivirus system extends its internal bytecode interpreter to support an LLVM JIT compiler.  This JIT compiler allows for improved execution speeds, but also provides the ability to write virus checks directly in C code. For more details, see the <a href="http://vrt-sourcefire.blogspot.com/2010/09/introduction-to-clamavs-low-level.html">Sourcefire Vulnerability Research Team's Blog</a>.<br /><br />-Chris
