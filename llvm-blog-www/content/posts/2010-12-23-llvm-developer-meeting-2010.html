title: LLVM Developer Meeting 2010
---

The <a href="http://www.llvm.org/devmtg/2010-11/">2010 edition</a> of the <a href="http://www.llvm.org/devmtg/">LLVM Developer's Meeting</a> has come and gone, and it was a great event.  It featured 17 great talks, several BOF sessions, and lots of informal discussions between all sorts of people interested in LLVM and its subprojects.  Lang Hames wrote up a great summary of <a href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2010/12/notes-from-2010-llvm-developers-meeting.html">his experience at the meeting</a>.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there was more people who wanted to attend than we were able to accomodate, but fortunately the slides and videos of all the talks are <a href="http://www.llvm.org/devmtg/2010-11/">available the web page</a>.  Many thanks go our to our sponsors: Apple, QuIC, Google, Qualcomm.<br /><br />Happy holidays,<br /><br />-Chris
