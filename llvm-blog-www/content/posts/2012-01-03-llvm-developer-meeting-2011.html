title: LLVM Developer Meeting 2011
---

The <a href="http://www.llvm.org/devmtg/2011-11/">2011 LLVM Devloper Meeting</a> has come and gone, and it was a great event.  It featured 17 great talks, several BOF sessions, a poster session, and lots of informal discussions between all sorts of people interested in LLVM and its subprojects. If you are interested in the talks, <a href="http://www.llvm.org/devmtg/2011-11/">slides and videos</a> are now available.<p>   The Developer Meeting would not be possible without support from our sponsors.  Many thanks to QuIC, Apple and Google.<p> Happy 2012!<p> -Chris
