The <a href="http://llvm.org/devmtg/2012-11/">2012 LLVM Developer Meeting</a> is now complete and was a great success.  If you are interested in the talks, a complete set of <a href="http://llvm.org/devmtg/2012-11/">slides, videos, and posters</a> are now available.  The LLVM Developer Meeting would not be possible without support from our sponsors. Many thanks to Apple, QuIC, Google, and Intel.  -Chris
