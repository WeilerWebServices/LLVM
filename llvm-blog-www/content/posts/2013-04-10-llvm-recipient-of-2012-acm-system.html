title: 'LLVM Recipient of the 2012 ACM System Software Award '
---

 The ACM <a href="http://www.acm.org/press-room/news-releases/2013/acm-tech-awards-2012">just announced</a> that the LLVM project is the recipient of the <a href="http://awards.acm.org/homepage.cfm?srt=all&awd=149">2012 ACM System Software Award</a>.  This award recognizes a "software system that has had a lasting influence, reflected in contributions to concepts, in commercial acceptance, or both."  Many important software systems are previous recipients of this award, including Eclipse, VMware, Eiffel, Make, Java, Apache, TCP/IP, PostScript, SMALLTALK, TeX, and UNIX (among others).<p> This is fantastic recognition for the impact LLVM has had on the compiler and languages industry, and is recognition that all LLVM Developers should feel proud of.
