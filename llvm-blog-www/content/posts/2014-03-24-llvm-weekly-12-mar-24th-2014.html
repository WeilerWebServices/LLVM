<p>Welcome to the twelfth issue of LLVM Weekly, a weekly newsletter (published  every Monday) covering developments in LLVM, Clang, and related projects. LLVM Weekly is brought to you by <a href="http://asbradbury.org">Alex Bradbury</a>. Subscribe to future issues at <a href="http://llvmweekly.org">http://llvmweekly.org</a> and pass it on to anyone  else you think may be interested. Please send any tips or feedback to  <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#97;&#115;&#98;&#64;&#97;&#115;&#98;&#114;&#97;&#100;&#98;&#117;&#114;&#121;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;">&#97;&#115;&#98;&#64;&#97;&#115;&#98;&#114;&#97;&#100;&#98;&#117;&#114;&#121;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/llvmweekly">@llvmweekly</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/asbradbury">@asbradbury</a> on Twitter.</p> <p>The canonical home for this issue <a href="http://llvmweekly.org/issue/12">can be found here at llvmweekly.org</a>. </p>  <a name='more'></a> <h3>News and articles from around the web</h3><ul><li><p>You may recall my previous coverage of efforts by Philip Reames and others  to introduce necessary changes to LLVM to support a precise relocating garbage  collector. Previously he <a href="http://www.philipreames.com/Blog/2014/02/21/why-not-use-gcroot/">described the issues of using the llvm.gcroot  intrinsic</a>. True to his word, he's followed up that post with a description of '<a href="http://www.philipreames.com/Blog/2014/03/18/late-safepoint-placement-overview/">late  safepoint  placement</a>',  which is the approach Philip and his colleagues are working on to address the  problem. More updates are promised over the next few weeks.</p></li><li><p>musl libc 1.0.0 <a href="http://www.musl-libc.org/download.html">has been released</a>. It is an MIT-licensed libc aiming to compete with glibc. "musl is a new  general-purpose implementation of the C library. It is lightweight, fast,  simple, free, and aims to be correct in the sense of standards-conformance and  safety."</p></li><li><p>The <a href="http://erllvm.softlab.ntua.gr/">LLVM backend for the HiPE Erlang  compiler</a> has been  <a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/commit/9d46875b53ffb21bc55aec4a2c76472133ea5d1c">merged</a>  in to the Erlang/OTP master branch.</p></li><li><p>The 'Mystical Programming blog' has an amusing article on <a href="http://mysticalprogramming.wordpress.com/2014/03/19/how-to-abuse-a-cpp-compiler/">non-terminating  C++ template  computations</a>  along with information on how GCC and Clang handle each example.</p></li><li><p>Meeting C++ have written up a <a href="http://meetingcpp.com/index.php/br/items/looking-at-c14.html">list of things likely to make their way in to  C++14</a>.</p></li><li><p><a href="http://www.ceemple.com/what-is-ceemple/">Ceemple</a>, an LLVM-based product  for technical computing, has been released. It's marketed as offering a number  of advantages over Python or MATLAB in this space.</p></li><li><p>The next Cambridge LLVM Social will <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/71338">take place on the 26th March,  7.30pm</a>.</p></li></ul><h3>On the mailing lists</h3><ul><li><p>David Given is working on an architecture that uses integer registers to  store floating point values, and <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/71368">asks for  advice</a> on how  to represent this in tablegen without being stopped dead by "cannot infer all  types in pattern" errors.</p></li><li><p>Renato Golin has <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/71340">kicked off another thread on unwinding and exception  handling and function  attributes</a>. He's done a fantastic job of summarising the issues and proposal on moving  forward which means I don't have to feel lazy by suggesting you just go read  the thread if you're interested.</p></li><li><p>Arch Robinson asks the list for <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/71307">advice on improving the SLPVectorizer in  order to help with Julia code he's looking  at</a>. The  <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/71308">response</a>  from Arnold Schwaighofer is worth a read for anyone interested in hacking in  this area.</p></li><li><p>Discussion about a binary format for instrumentation-based profiling data  has  <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/71306">continued</a>,  with the suggestion that the format written out by instrumentation need not be  the same as the format read back by the compiler (it could be transformed by  other tools). Justin Bogner has detailed <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/71434">proposed  requirements</a>  for these formats.</p></li><li><p>Tim Hill started an interesting discussion by <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/35755">sharing his experiences from  switching to  Clang</a>. Among  the positives were excellent errors, the static analyzer, compatibility, and  quality of generated code. The main negative is the lack of documentation for  many compiler options. There's general agreement in the responses that this is  a problem that should be fixed in the (hopefully not too distant) future.</p></li><li><p>Lang Hames has <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/71352">proposed an RFC on adding an empty method to  <code>iterator_range</code></a>. If debating API design is your cup of tea, prepare to be entertained.</p></li></ul><h3>LLVM commits</h3><ul><li><p>The MIPS64r2-based Octeon CPU has been added. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL204337">r204337</a>.</p></li><li><p>The ProfileData library, <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/71179">discussed last  week</a> was  committed. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL204482">r204482</a>,  <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL204489">r204489</a>.</p></li><li><p>The constant hoisting pass saw some refactoring and improvements. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL204431">r204431</a>,  <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL204433">r204433</a>,  <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL204435">r204435</a>,  <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL204537">r204537</a>.</p></li><li><p>The ARM integrated assembler learned how to handle the <code>.thumb_set</code>  directive. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL204059">r204059</a>.</p></li><li><p>Assembler directives were added to create version-min load commands for iOS  or Mac OSX. e.g. <code>.ios_version_min 5,2,0</code>. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL204190">r204190</a>.</p></li><li><p>It is now possible to specify the 'noduplicate' attribution for intrinsics. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL204200">r204200</a>.</p></li><li><p>The TableGen backends documentation was fleshed out a bit. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL204479">r204479</a>.</p></li><li><p>Scheduling annotations have been added to NEON AArch64 instructions. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL204505">r204505</a>.</p></li></ul><h3>Clang commits</h3><ul><li><p>Counters used in instrumentation-based profiling are now represented in a  static array. This is the first commit of a larger project to reduce runtime  overhead (initialization in particular) for instrumentation-based profiling. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL204080">r204080</a>. Other commits for  instrumentation-based profiling include  <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL204186">r204186</a>,  <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL204379">r204379</a>,  <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL204390">r204390</a>. There's a matching set  of commits in compiler-rt.</p></li><li><p>The deprecated <code>-faddress-sanitizer</code>, <code>-fthread-sanitizer</code>, and  <code>-fcatch-undefined-behavior</code> flags were removed. Users whould use  <code>-fsanitize=</code> instead. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL204330">r204330</a>.</p></li><li><p>Support for parsing the OpenMP safelen clause (for 'omp simd') was  committed. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL204428">r204428</a>.</p></li></ul><h3>Other project commits</h3><ul><li><p>Support was added to MemorySanitizer for 'advanced origin tracking', which  records all locations where an uninitialized value is stored to memory rather  than just the creation point. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL204152">r204152</a>.</p></li><li><p>The lldb backtrace view has been changed to a process view where you can  expand the process, its threads, and see all frames under each thread. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL204251">r204251</a>.</p></li><li><p>In compiler-rt, Google have re-licensed the Android ucontext implementation  under the standard dual license of compiler-rt. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL204128">r204128</a>.</p></li></ul>
