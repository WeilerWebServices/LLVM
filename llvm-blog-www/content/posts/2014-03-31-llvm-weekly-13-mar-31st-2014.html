<p>Welcome to the thirteenth issue of LLVM Weekly, a weekly newsletter (published  every Monday) covering developments in LLVM, Clang, and related projects. LLVM Weekly is brought to you by <a href="http://asbradbury.org">Alex Bradbury</a>. Subscribe to future issues at <a href="http://llvmweekly.org">http://llvmweekly.org</a> and pass it on to anyone  else you think may be interested. Please send any tips or feedback to  <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#97;&#115;&#98;&#64;&#97;&#115;&#98;&#114;&#97;&#100;&#98;&#117;&#114;&#121;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;">&#97;&#115;&#98;&#64;&#97;&#115;&#98;&#114;&#97;&#100;&#98;&#117;&#114;&#121;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/llvmweekly">@llvmweekly</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/asbradbury">@asbradbury</a> on Twitter.</p><p>Thanks in no small part to a <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/6535">mention on the Raspberry Pi  blog</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Learning-Python-Raspberry-Alex-Bradbury/dp/1118717058/">Learning Python with  Raspberry  Pi</a>  by myself and Ben Everard is at the time of writing #1 in the Programming  books section on Amaon UK. Also, keep your eyes on the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/X-Dev-London/">X-Dev London meetup  page</a> as I'm expecting to give an  LLVM-related talk there on the 9th April, though it's not listed yet and is  subject to change.</p> <p>The canonical home for this issue <a href="http://llvmweekly.org/issue/13">can be found here at llvmweekly.org</a>. </p>  <a name='more'></a> <h3>News and articles from around the web</h3><p>It's only a week to go until <a href="http://llvm.org/devmtg/2014-04/">EuroLLVM 2014</a>,  which wil be held in Edinburgh on the 7th and 8th of April. Tragically I'm not  going to be there as I'm trying to focus on getting my PhD finished, but the  schedule looks fantastic.</p><p>The Linux Collaboration Summit featured an update on progress of the LLVMLinux  project to build the Linux kernel using LLVM/Clang  (<a href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/sites/events/files/slides/2014-Collab-LLVMLinux.pdf">slides</a>). As of right now, there are approximately 48 kernel patches still working their  way upstream for the project.</p><p>John Regehr has written an interesting blog post on the subject of <a href="http://blog.regehr.org/archives/1122">using Z3  to prove some things about LLVM  optimisations</a>.</p><p>Facebook have <a href="https://code.facebook.com/posts/476987592402291/under-the-hood-warp-a-fast-c-and-c-preprocessor/">released the Warp C and C++  preprocessor</a>,  written in D. It claims to benchmark much faster than GCC's preprocessor  resulting in faster build times, though a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7489532">quick comparison with  Clang</a> didn't show it in a  favourable light speed-wise.</p><p>Meeting C++ have published a helpful summary of <a href="http://meetingcpp.com/index.php/br/items/cpp-status.html">what might make its way in to  C++17 or C++1y</a>.</p><h3>On the mailing lists</h3><ul><li><p>Apple are <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/71638">contributing their 64-bit ARM backend  upstream</a>. Initially, this will co-exist with the current AArch64 backend (the Apple  implementation is called ARM64), and over time the backends will be merged.</p></li><li><p>Tom Stellard has [announced a tentative release schedule for LLVM and Clang  3.4.1] and is searching for volunteers to test, as well as nominations for  patches that should be included. The proposed schedule is Mar 26 - April 9:  Identify and backport additional bug fixes to the 3.4 branch. April 9 - April  18: Testing Phase April 18: 3.4.1 Release</p></li><li><p>Frank Winter started a discussion on <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/71487">how to specify the alignment of a  pointer in LLVM  IR</a>, which  yields some interesting responses.</p></li><li><p>Renato Golin kicked off a <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/71567">discussion about supporting named registers in  LLVM/Clang</a>. This is a GNU extension not currently supported. There seemed to be some  agreement that this is worth supporting, which resulted in a follow-on thread  on <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/71625">how to implement support for named  registers</a>.</p></li><li><p>A <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/35858">query from Geoffrey  Irving</a> about  how to safely make use of floating point rounding mode resulted in an  interesting discussion about how a changing rounding modes could be supported. For example, with the introduction of a <code>fp_rounding_sensitive</code> annotation.</p></li></ul><h3>LLVM commits</h3><ul><li><p>The ARM big-endian targets armeb and thumbeb have been added. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL205007">r205007</a>.</p></li><li><p>Apple's ARM64 backend has been merged, and will for a time live side-by-side  with the existing AArch64 backend (see 'on the mailing lists' for more  details). <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL205090">r205090</a>.</p></li><li><p>The <code>@llvm.clear_cache</code> builtin has been born. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL204802">r204802</a>,  <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL204806">r204806</a>.</p></li><li><p>Windows target triple spellings have been canonicalised.

This  was added for ARM64. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL205101">r205101</a>.</p></li></ul><h3>Other project commits</h3><ul><li><p>ThreadSanitizer has new benchmarks for synchronization handling. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL204608">r204608</a>.</p></li><li><p>Initial infrastructure for IEEE quad precision was added to compiler-rt. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL204999">r204999</a>.</p></li><li><p>LLD gained the <code>--allow-multiple-definition</code> and <code>--defsym</code> options. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL205015">r205015</a>,  <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL205029">r205029</a>.</p></li><li><p>In LLDB, JITed function can now have debug info and be debugged with debug  and source info. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL204682">r204682</a>.</p></li><li><p>ThreadSanitizer vector clock operations have been optimized and are now O(1)  for several important use cases. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL204656">r204656</a>.</p></li></ul>
