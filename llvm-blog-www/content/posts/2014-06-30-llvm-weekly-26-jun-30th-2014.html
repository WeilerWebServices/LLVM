<p>Welcome to the twenty-sixth issue of LLVM Weekly, a weekly newsletter  (published every Monday) covering developments in LLVM, Clang, and related  projects. LLVM Weekly is brought to you by <a href="http://asbradbury.org">Alex Bradbury</a>. Subscribe to future issues at <a href="http://llvmweekly.org">http://llvmweekly.org</a> and pass it on to anyone  else you think may be interested. Please send any tips or feedback to  <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#97;&#115;&#98;&#64;&#97;&#115;&#98;&#114;&#97;&#100;&#98;&#117;&#114;&#121;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;">&#97;&#115;&#98;&#64;&#97;&#115;&#98;&#114;&#97;&#100;&#98;&#117;&#114;&#121;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/llvmweekly">@llvmweekly</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/asbradbury">@asbradbury</a> on Twitter.</p> <p>The canonical home for this issue <a href="http://llvmweekly.org/issue/26">can be found here at llvmweekly.org</a>. </p>  <a name='more'></a> <h3>News and articles from around the web</h3><p>Vladmir Makarov has done his <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2014-06/msg00254.html">yearly comparison of GCC and  LLVM</a>, posting performance  comparisons using SPECInt2000 on ARM and x86-64.</p><p>Version 0.13.0 of LDC, the LLVM-based D compiler has <a href="https://github.com/ldc-developers/ldc/releases/tag/v0.13.0">been  released</a>. This  brings a whole host of improvements, listed in detail within the release  announcement.</p><p>Some Mozilla engineers have been looking at using clang-cl (the  MSVC-compatible Clang driver) to build Firefox. With the help of the fallback  flag (which falls back o compiling with MSVC if Clang fails) they've <a href="http://ehsanakhgari.org/blog/2014-06-26/building-firefox-on-windows-with-clang-cl">managed  to get a completed  build</a>. Ehsan tells us that <a href="https://twitter.com/ehsanakhgari/status/482271470010105857">602 of the 7168 files, about 8% require the MSVC  fallback</a> at the  moment.</p><p>Trail of Bits have posted a <a href="http://blog.trailofbits.com/2014/06/23/a-preview-of-mcsema/">preview of  McSema</a>, a  framework for translating x86 binaries to LLVM bitcode. The accompanying talk  took place on the 28th June, so hopefully we'll hear more about this soon. The  blog post tells us that McSema will be open source and made available soon.</p><p>Bruce Mitchener has written up his <a href="http://dylanfoundry.org/2014/06/25/integrating-with-lldb/">experience of integrating with LLDB for  Dylan</a>.</p><p>Codeplay (based in Edinburgh) are advertising for a <a href="http://www.codeplay.com/company/jobs/view.html?uid=12#.U7B4jzksa00">full time compiler  engineer</a>.</p><h3>On the mailing lists</h3><ul><li><p>Alp Toker kicked off a <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/74274">long thread about the use of Phabricator for code  reviews</a>. The  main problem is that Phabricator reviews aren't necessarily going through  llvm-commits which is potentially harming development. A very sensible step  has been taken of <a href="https://secure.phabricator.com/T5495">filing a feature request with  Phabricator</a> for the ability to warn  when no mailing list is subscribed to a code review.</p></li><li><p>James Molloy has <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/74269">shared some rough benchmark data on LLVM targeting  Cortex-A57</a>. For SPEC, LLVM is apparently less than 5% behind GCC for most benchmarks. James also lists a number of missed optimisation opportunities he's noticed so  far in comparing the output.</p></li><li><p>Alexander Kornienko <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/74314">questions whether it's time to bump the minimum Python  requirement from 2.5 to  2.7</a>. Replies  o the thread made the distinction between the minimum to run tests using lit  (which is written in Python) and the minimum for tooling scripts that may need  to be less portable. Despite 2.5 being ancient, the reason for wanting to  support it is for long-lived releases such as RHEL.</p></li><li><p>Diego Novillo <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/74351">suggests turning on debug column info by  default</a>. He  found almost no difference in compile time and only a 1% growth in debug info  size. There seems to be support for doing this, with the only concern being  that some debuggers might not interpret the data properly leading to odd  behaviour. David Blaikie found a <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/74376">few regressions in the gdb test  suite</a>, but  has yet to investigate further.</p></li></ul><h3>LLVM commits</h3><ul><li><p>A significant overhaul of how vector lowering is done in the x86 backend has  been started. While it's under development it's off by default, though it's  hoped that in times there will be measurable performance improvements on  benchmarks conducive to vectorization. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL211888">r211888</a> and more.</p></li><li><p>X86 FastISel will use EFLAGS directly when lowering select instructions if  the condition comes from a compare. It also now supports floating-point  selects among other improvements. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL211543">r211543</a>,  <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL211544">r211544</a>, and more.</p></li><li><p>ScaledNumber has been split out from BlockFrequencyInfo into the Support  library. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL211562">r211562</a>.</p></li><li><p>The loop vectorizer now features <code>-Rpass-missed</code> and <code>-Rpass-analysis</code>  reports. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL211721">r211721</a>.</p></li><li><p>The developer documentation has been updated to clarify that although you  can use Phabricator to submit code for review, you should also ensure the  relevant -commits mailing list is added as a subscriber on the review and be  prepared to respond to comments there. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL211731">r211731</a>.</p></li><li><p>COMDATs have been added to the IR. What's a COMDAT? <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/2440933">StackOverflow has you  covered</a>. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL211920">r211920</a>.</p></li><li><p>The NVPTX backend saw a whole series of commits. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL211930">r211930</a>,  <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL211932">r211932</a>,  <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL211935">r211935</a>, and more.</p></li><li><p>LLVM gained an abstraction for a random number generator (RNG). <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL211705">r211705</a>.</p></li></ul><h3>Clang commits</h3><ul><li><p>A nice little diagnostic improvement has been added for when the user  accidentally puts braces before the identifer, e.g. <code>int [4] foo;</code>. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL211641">r211641</a>.</p></li><li><p>OpenMP learned the 'section' directive (and some more, see the full commit  logs). <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL211685">r211685</a>,  <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL211767">r211767</a>.</p></li></ul><h3>Other project commits</h3><ul><li><p>Support for ARM EHABI unwinding was added to libunwind. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL211743">r211743</a>.</p></li><li><p>The lldb Machine Interface gained a number of new commands and bug fixes. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL211607">r211607</a>.</p></li></ul>
