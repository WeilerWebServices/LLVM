<p>Welcome to the thirty-second issue of LLVM Weekly, a weekly newsletter  (published every Monday) covering developments in LLVM, Clang, and related  projects. LLVM Weekly is brought to you by <a href="http://asbradbury.org">Alex  Bradbury</a>.Subscribe to future issues at  <a href="http://llvmweekly.org">http://llvmweekly.org</a> and pass it on to anyone else you think may be  interested. Please send any tips or feedback to  <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#97;&#115;&#98;&#64;&#97;&#115;&#98;&#114;&#97;&#100;&#98;&#117;&#114;&#121;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;">&#97;&#115;&#98;&#64;&#97;&#115;&#98;&#114;&#97;&#100;&#98;&#117;&#114;&#121;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/llvmweekly">@llvmweekly</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/asbradbury">@asbradbury</a> on Twitter.</p><p>Some readers may be interested to know that <a href="http://lowrisc.org/">lowRISC</a>, a  project to produce a fully open-source SoC started by a number of us at the  University of Cambridge Computer Lab has been announced. <a href="http://www.jobs.cam.ac.uk/job/4665/">We are  hiring</a>.</p> <p>The canonical home for this issue <a href="http://llvmweekly.org/issue/32">can be found here at llvmweekly.org</a>. </p>  <a name='more'></a> <h3>News and articles from around the web</h3><p>Codeplay contributed the LLDB MI (Machine Interface) frontend a while ago, and  have now committed some additional features. To coincide with that, they've  published a <a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/lldb-dev/2014-August/004768.html">series of blog  posts</a>  covering the MI driver's implementation, how to set it up from within Eclipse,  and how to add support for new MI commands.</p><p>McSema, a framework for transforming x86 programs to LLVM bitcode has <a href="http://blog.trailofbits.com/2014/08/07/mcsema-is-officially-open-source/">now  been  open-sourced</a>. The talk about McSema from the ReCON conference is also now online.</p><p>Registration for the LLVM Developer's Meeting 2014 is <a href="http://llvm.org/devmtg/2014-10/#registration">now  open</a>. The event will take place  in San Jose on October 28th-29th. You have until September 1st to <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/75567">submit your  talk/BoF/poster/tutorial  proposal</a>.</p><h3>On the mailing lists</h3><ul><li><p>Robin Morisset, currently an intern at Google has <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/75534">written about his plan to  optimize C11/C++11 atomics in  LLVM</a>. This  resulted in a discussion on <a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/llvmdev/2014-August/075573.html">whether some of these transformation should be  done at the IR  level</a>.</p></li><li><p>Dan Liew has written a long post about <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/75575">re-organising and improving  zorg</a> (LLVM's  testing and buildbot infrastructure).</p></li><li><p>Eric Christopher has written to the mailing list to warn us of <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/75475">incoming API  changes</a>. These changes include modifying getSubtarget/getSubtargetImpl to take a  Function/MachineFunction, so sub-targets could be used based on attributes on  the function.</p></li><li><p>Sergey Ostanevich from Intel has  <a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/llvmdev/2014-August/075606.html">shared</a> a  <a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/llvmdev/attachments/20140809/cd6c7f7a/attachment-0001.pdf">proposal for the implementation of OpenMP offloading in  LLVM</a>. This proposal was created by contributors from IBM, Intel, ANL, TI, and AMD. The example given would allow code to be offloaded to e.g. a Xeon Phi  co-processor if present, or a GPU.</p></li><li><p>Delesley Hutchins has <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/38248">shared an update on his work on thread safety  analysis</a>. This details the recently added negative capabilities patch. He is looking for  feedback on how to limit the propagation of negative capabilities.</p></li></ul><h3>LLVM commits</h3><ul><li><p>Initial work on the MachineCombiner pass landed. This estimates critical  path length of the original instruction sequence vs a transformed (combined)  instruction sequence and chooses the faster code. An example given in the  commit message is choosing between add+mul vs madd on AArch64, and a followup  commit implements MachineCombiner for this target. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL214666">r214666</a>,  <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL214669">r214669</a>.</p></li><li><p>A few useful helper functions were added to the LLVM C API:  <code>LLVM{IsConstantString, GetAsString, GetElementAsConstant}</code>. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL214676">r214976</a>.</p></li><li><p>A whole load of AVX512 instructions were added. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL214719">r214719</a>.</p></li><li><p>FastISel for AArch64 now support basic argument lowering. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL214846">r214846</a>.</p></li><li><p>A flag has been added to experiment with running the loop vectorizer before  the SLP vectorizer. According to the commit message, eventually this should be  the default. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL214963">r214963</a>.</p></li><li><p>The old JIT is almost dead, it has been removed (for those not paying close  attention, 3.5 has already been branched so still contains the old JIT).  However, the patch was then reverted, so it's in zombie status. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL215111">r215111</a>.</p></li><li><p>AArch64 gained a load balancing pass for the Cortex-A57, which tries to make  maximum use of available resources by balancing use of even and odd FP  registers. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL215199">r215199</a>.</p></li></ul><h3>Clang commits</h3><ul><li><p>Thread safety analysis gained support for negative requirements to be  specified. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL214725">r214725</a>.</p></li><li><p>Coverage mapping generation has been committed. The <code>-fcoverage-mapping</code>  command line option can be used to generate coverage mapping information,  which can then be combined with execution counts from instrumentation-based  profiling to perform code coverage analysis. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL214752">r214752</a>.</p></li><li><p>A command line option to limit the alignment that the compiler can assume  for an arbitrary pointer. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL214911">r214911</a>.</p></li></ul><h3>Other project commits</h3><ul><li><p>LLDB's FileSpec class learned to understand Windows paths. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL215123">r215123</a>.</p></li><li><p>LLDB learned a whole bunch of new commands and features for its Machine  Interface. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL215223">r215223</a>.</p></li><li><p>OpenMP gained PowerPC64 support. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL215093">r215093</a>.</p></li></ul>
