<p>Welcome to the fortieth issue of LLVM Weekly, a weekly newsletter (published  every Monday) covering developments in LLVM, Clang, and related projects. LLVM Weekly is brought to you by <a href="http://asbradbury.org">Alex Bradbury</a>. Subscribe to future issues at <a href="http://llvmweekly.org">http://llvmweekly.org</a> and pass it on to anyone  else you think may be interested. Please send any tips or feedback to  <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#97;&#115;&#98;&#64;&#97;&#115;&#98;&#114;&#97;&#100;&#98;&#117;&#114;&#121;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;">&#97;&#115;&#98;&#64;&#97;&#115;&#98;&#114;&#97;&#100;&#98;&#117;&#114;&#121;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/llvmweekly">@llvmweekly</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/asbradbury">@asbradbury</a> on Twitter.</p><p>I'll be in Munich next weekend for the <a href="http://tum-lis.github.io/orconf2014/">OpenRISC  conference</a> where I'll be presenting on  the <a href="http://lowrisc.org/">lowRISC</a> project to produce an open-source SoC. I'll  be giving a similar talk in London at the Open Source Hardware User Group <a href="http://oshug.org/event/36">on  23rd October</a>.</p>  <p>The canonical home for this issue <a href="http://llvmweekly.org/issue/40">can be found here at llvmweekly.org</a>. </p>  <a name='more'></a> <h3>News and articles from around the web</h3><p>Capstone 3.0 RC1 <a href="http://capstone-engine.org/Version-3.0-RC1.html">has been  released</a> Capstone is an open  source disassembly engine, based initially on code from LLVM. This release  features support for Sparc, SystemZ and XCore as well as the previously  supported architectures. Among other changes, the Python bindings are now  compatible with Python 3.</p><p>An interesting paper from last year came up on the mailing list. From EPFL, it  proposes <a href="http://dslab.epfl.ch/pubs/overify.pdf">adding -OVERIFY to optimise programs for fast  verification</a>. The performance of  symbolic execution tools is improved by reducing the number of paths to  explore and the complexity of branch conditions. They managed a maximum 95x  reduction in total compilation and analysis time.</p><p>The next Cambridge (UK) social <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/77453">will take place on Wed 8th Oct at 7.30  pm</a>.</p><h3>On the mailing lists</h3><ul><li><p>Reid Kleckner has posted an RFC on <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/39152">approaches to representing structured  exception handling (SEH) in LLVM  IR</a>. This is  the exception handling model used on Windows.</p></li><li><p>Chandler Carruth has written to the list to <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/77439">announce his new x86 vector  shuffle lowering path is now enabled by  default</a>. This  code path has seen extensive fuzz testing. The performance improvement is  largest on AMD chips with older SSE versions. If anyone is able to find a  performance regression, you are encouraged to report it.</p></li><li><p>Richard Pennington who maintains the Clang/LLVM ELLCC cross-development  toolchain is <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/77431">considering dropping support for  Microblaze</a>. The Microblaze backend was dropped from LLVM last year, but Richard has been  maintaining it out of tree. However there seems to be very little actual  interest. If somebody wants to pick it up, now is the time to jump in.</p></li></ul><h3>LLVM commits</h3><ul><li><p>The expansion of atomic loads/stores for PowerPC has been improved. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL218922">r218922</a>. The documentation on atomics has  also been updated. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL218937">r218937</a>.</p></li><li><p>For the past few weeks, Chandler Carruth has been working on a new vector  shuffle lowering implementation. There have been too many commits to  summarise, but the time has come and the new codepath is now enabled by  default. It claims 5-40% improvements in the right conditions (when the loop  vectorizer fires in the hot path for SSE2/SSE3). <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL219046">r219046</a>.</p></li><li><p>The Cortex-A57 scheduling model has been refined. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL218627">r218627</a>.</p></li><li><p>SimplifyCFG now has a configurable threshold for folding branches with  common destination. Changing this threshold can be worthwhile for GPU programs  where branches are expensive. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL218711">r218711</a>.</p></li><li><p>Basic support for the newly-announced Cortex-M7 has been added. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL218747">r218747</a>.</p></li><li><p>As discussed on the mailing list last week, the sqrt intrinsic will now  return undef when given a negative input. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL218803">r218803</a>.</p></li><li><p>llvm-readobj learnt <code>-coff-imports</code> which will print out the COFF import  table. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL218891">r218891</a>,  <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL218915">r218915</a>.</p></li></ul><h3>Clang commits</h3><ul><li><p>Support for the <code>align_value</code> attribute has been added, matching the  behaviour of the attribute in the Intel compiler. The commit message explains  why this attribute is useful in addition to <code>aligned</code>. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL218910">r218910</a>.</p></li><li><p>A rather useful diagnostic has been added. <code>-Winconsistent-missing-override</code>  will warn if override is missing on an overridden method if that class has at  least one override specified on its methods. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL218925">r218925</a>.</p></li><li><p>Support for MS ABI continues. <code>thread_local</code> is now supported for global  variables. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL219074">r219074</a>.</p></li><li><p>Matcher and DynTypedMatcher saw some nice performance tweaking, resulting in  a 14% improvement on a clang-tidy benchmark and compilation of  Dynamic/Registry.cpp sped up by 17%. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL218679">r218616</a>.</p></li><li><p>lifetime.start and lifetime.end markers are now emitted for unnamed  temporary objects. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL218865">r218865</a>.</p></li><li><p>The <code>__sync_fetch_and_nand</code> intrinsic was re-added. See the commit message  for a history of its removal. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL218905">r218905</a>.</p></li><li><p>Clang gained its own implementation of C11 <code>stdatomic.h</code>. The system header  will be used in preference if present. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL218957">r218957</a>.</p></li><li><p>Clang now understands <code>-mthread-model</code> to specify the thread model to use,  e.g. posix, single (for bare-metal and single-threaded targets). <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL219027">r219027</a>.</p></li></ul><h3>Other project commits</h3><ul><li><p>libcxxabi should now work with the ARM Cortex-M0. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL218869">r218869</a>.</p></li><li><p>lldb gained initial support for scripting stepping. This is the ability to  add new stepping modes implemented by python classes. The example in the  follow-on commit has a large comment at the head of the file to explain its  operation. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL218642">r218642</a>,  <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL218650">r218650</a>.</p></li></ul>
