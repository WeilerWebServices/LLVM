<p>Welcome to the fifty-second issue of LLVM Weekly, a weekly newsletter  (published every Monday) covering developments in LLVM, Clang, and related  projects. LLVM Weekly is brought to you by <a href="http://asbradbury.org">Alex  Bradbury</a>. Subscribe to future issues at  <a href="http://llvmweekly.org">http://llvmweekly.org</a> and pass it on to anyone else you think may be  interested. Please send any tips or feedback to <a    href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#97;&#115;&#98;&#64;&#97;&#115;&#98;&#114;&#97;&#100;&#98;&#117;&#114;&#121;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;">&#97;&#115;&#98;&#64;&#97;&#115;&#98;&#114;&#97;&#100;&#98;&#117;&#114;&#121;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;</a>,  or <a href="https://twitter.com/llvmweekly">@llvmweekly</a> or <a    href="https://twitter.com/asbradbury">@asbradbury</a> on Twitter.</p><p>This issue marks the end of one full year of LLVM Weekly. It's a little  shorter than usual as the frenetic pace of LLVM/Clang development has slowed  over the holiday period. Surprising even to me is that we managed to make it  full all 52 weeks with an issue every Monday as promised. This requires a  non-trivial amount of time each week (2-3+ hours), but I am intending to keep  it going into 2015. I'd like to give a big thank you to everyone who's said hi  at a conference, sent in corrections or tips on content, or just sent a random  thank you. It's been very helpful in motivation. I don't currently intend to  change anything about the structure or content of each issue for next year,  but if you have any ideas then please let me know.</p><p>I can't make it to 31C3 due to the awkward timing of the event, but do let me  know if there are any LLVM/Clang related talks worth sharing. There was a  <a href="https://events.ccc.de/congress/2014/Fahrplan/events/6050.html">talk about Code Pointer  Integrity</a>  which has previously been covered in LLVM Weekly and is working towards  upstreaming. The video is <a href="http://streaming.media.ccc.de/relive/6050">here</a>. If you're interested in <a href="http://www.lowrisc.org">lowRISC</a> and at 31C3, Bunnie  is leading a <a href="https://events.ccc.de/congress/2014/wiki/Session:LowRISC_Discussion">discussion about it</a>at 2pm on Monday (today).</p> <p>The canonical home for this issue <a href="http://llvmweekly.org/issue/52">can be found here at llvmweekly.org</a>. </p>  <a name='more'></a> <h3>News and articles from around the web</h3><p>There doesn't seem to have been any LLVM or Clang related news over the past  week. Everyone seems to be busy with non-LLVM related activities over the  christmas break. If you're looking for a job though, Codeplay tell me they  have two vancancies: one for a <a href="https://www.codeplay.com/company/jobs/view.html?uid=15#.VJft5P84JA">debugger  engineer</a>  and another for a <a href="https://www.codeplay.com/company/jobs/view.html?uid=12#.VJft7_84JA">compiler engineer</a>.</p><h3>On the mailing lists</h3><ul><li><p>David Li has shared some <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/80167">early info on Google's plans for  LTO</a>. He  describes the concept of 'peak optimization performance' and some of the  objectives of the new design. This includes the ability to handle programs 10x  or 100x the size of Firefox. We can expect more information in 2015, maybe as  early as January.</p></li><li><p>The discussion on possible approaches to reducing the size of libLLVM has  continued. Chris Bieneman has <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/80096">shared some more size  stats</a>. These  gains come from removing unused intrinsics. Chandler Carruth has followed up  with a pleasingly thought-provoking argument on a different approach:  <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/80130">target-specific intrinsics shouldn't exist in the LLVM front or  middle-end</a>. He describes the obvious issues with this, with the most fiddly probably being  instruction selection converting appropriate IR to the right target-specific  functionality.</p></li></ul><h3>LLVM commits</h3><ul><li><p>The SROA (scalar replacement of aggregates) pass has seen some refactoring  to, in the future, allow for more intelligent rewriting. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL224742">r224742</a>,  <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL224798">r224798</a>.</p></li><li><p>The masked load and store intrinsics have been documented. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL224832">r224832</a>.</p></li><li><p>CodeGenPrepare learned to speculate calls to llvm.cttz/ctlz (count  trailing/leading zeroes) if <code>isCheapToSpeculateCtlz/isCheapToSpeculatCttz</code> in  TargetLowering return true. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL224899">r224899</a>.</p></li></ul><h3>Clang commits</h3><ul><li>The Clang internals manual has been extended with stub sections on Parse,  Sema, and CodeGen. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL224894">r224894</a>.</li></ul><h3>Other project commits</h3><ul><li>The libcxx LIT test-suite has seen a number of new configuration options. Even better, these are <a href="http://libcxx.llvm.org/lit_usage.html">now documented</a>. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL224728">r224728</a>.</li></ul>
