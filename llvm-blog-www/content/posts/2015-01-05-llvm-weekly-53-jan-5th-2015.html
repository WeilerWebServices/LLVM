<p>Welcome to the fifty-third issue of LLVM Weekly, a weekly newsletter  (published every Monday) covering developments in LLVM, Clang, and related  projects. LLVM Weekly is brought to you by <a href="http://asbradbury.org">Alex  Bradbury</a>. Subscribe to future issues at  <a href="http://llvmweekly.org">http://llvmweekly.org</a> and pass it on to anyone else you think may be  interested. Please send any tips or feedback to <a    href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#97;&#115;&#98;&#64;&#97;&#115;&#98;&#114;&#97;&#100;&#98;&#117;&#114;&#121;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;">&#97;&#115;&#98;&#64;&#97;&#115;&#98;&#114;&#97;&#100;&#98;&#117;&#114;&#121;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;</a>,  or <a href="https://twitter.com/llvmweekly">@llvmweekly</a> or <a    href="https://twitter.com/asbradbury">@asbradbury</a> on Twitter.</p><p>I'm going to be in California next week for the <a href="http://riscv.org/workshop">RISC-V  workshop</a>. I'm arriving at SFO on Monday 12th and  leaving on Sunday the 18th. Do let me know if you want to meet and talk <a href="http://www.lowrisc.org">lowRISC</a>/RISC-V  or LLVM, and we'll see what we can do.</p> <p>The canonical home for this issue <a href="http://llvmweekly.org/issue/53">can be found here at llvmweekly.org</a>. </p>  <a name='more'></a> <h3>News and articles from around the web</h3><p>I was getting ready to break out gitstats for some analysis of the LLVM repo  and I find to my delight that Phoronix has saved me the trouble and has  <a href="http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=MTg3OTA">shared some stats on activity in the LLVM repo over the past year</a>.</p><p>Tom Stellard has made a blog post <a href="http://www.stellard.net/tom/blog/?p=69">announcing some recent RadeonSI performance  improvements</a> on his LLVM development  branch. This includes 60% improvement in one OpenCL benchmark and 10-25% in a  range of other OpenCL tests.</p><p>GaÃ«tan Lehmann has written a blog post about <a href="http://blog.glehmann.net/2014/12/29/Playing-with-libclang/">getting started with libclang  using the Python  bindings</a>.</p><p>The C++ Filesystem Technical Specification, based on the Boost.Filesystem  library <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lib.boost.devel/256220">has been  approved</a>.</p><h3>On the mailing lists</h3><ul><li><p>Virgile Bello has some questions on <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/80215">how he can control the calling  convention in LLVM</a>. In this case, he has an CLR frontend and is trying to pass an object on the  CLR stack to a native Win32 function. Reid Kleckner  <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/80217">suggests</a> the  best way may be to just link with Clang and use its implementation. In another  followup, he links to the <a href="http://llvm.org/devmtg/2014-10/Slides/Skip%20the%20FFI.pdf">talk on this  topic</a> at the last  LLVM dev meeting.</p></li><li><p><a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/40426">Is anybody using the ModuleBuilder class in  Clang?</a>. If  so, now is the time to speak up as it's slated to be removed.</p></li><li><p>Sami Liedes has <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/40474">set up a new bot to test Clang with fuzzed  inputs</a>. A  report from the bot is available  <a href="http://sli.dy.fi/~sliedes/clang-triage/triage_report.xhtml">here</a> and the  code is <a href="https://github.com/sliedes/clang-triage">here</a>.</p></li><li><p>The release of LLVM/Clang 3.5.1 may be slightly delayed due to the addition  of new patches late in the process. Chandler Carruth <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/80202">points  out</a> that  there are some unpleasant bugs in InstCombine in the current 3.5.1 release  candidate. If there is a release candidate 3, the patch in question will  definitely make it in.</p></li></ul><h3>LLVM commits</h3><ul><li><p>Instruction selection for bit-permuting operations on PowerPC has been  improved. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL225056">r225056</a>.</p></li><li><p>The scalar replacement of aggregates (SROA) pass has started to learn how to  more intelligently handle split loads and stores. As explained in detail in  the commit message, the old approach lead to complex IR that can be difficult  for the optimizer to work with. SROA is now also more aggressive in its  splitting of loads. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL225061">r225061</a>,  <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL225074">r225074</a>.</p></li><li><p>InstCombine will now try to transform <code>A-B &lt; 0</code> in to <code>A &lt; B</code>. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL225034">r225034</a>.</p></li><li><p>The Hexagon (a Qualcomm DSP) backend has seen quite a lot of work recently. Interested parties are best of flicking through the commit log of  lib/Target/Hexagon. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL225005">r225005</a>,  <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL225006">r225006</a>, etc.</p></li></ul><h3>Clang commits</h3><ul><li>More crash bugs have been uncovered and fixed by the <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/79491">naive fuzzing  technique</a>  previously covered in LLVM Weekly. e.g. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL224915">r224915</a>.</li></ul><h3>Other project commits</h3><ul><li>The lldb website has been updated with more information about LLDB on  windows, including <a href="http://lldb.llvm.org/build.html#BuildingLldbOnWindows">build  instructions</a>. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL225023">r225023</a>.</li></ul>
