<p>Welcome to the seventy-eighth issue of LLVM Weekly, a weekly newsletter  (published every Monday) covering developments in LLVM, Clang, and related  projects. LLVM Weekly is brought to you by <a href="http://asbradbury.org">Alex  Bradbury</a>. Subscribe to future issues at  <a href="http://llvmweekly.org">http://llvmweekly.org</a> and pass it on to anyone else you think may be  interested. Please send any tips or feedback to <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#97;&#115;&#98;&#64;&#97;&#115;&#98;&#114;&#97;&#100;&#98;&#117;&#114;&#121;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;">&#97;&#115;&#98;&#64;&#97;&#115;&#98;&#114;&#97;&#100;&#98;&#117;&#114;&#121;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/llvmweekly">@llvmweekly</a> or <a    href="https://twitter.com/asbradbury">@asbradbury</a> on Twitter.</p><p>I'm in the Bay Area this week for the <a href="http://riscv.org/workshop-jun2015.html">second RISC-V  workshop</a> where my colleague and I  will of course be talking about <a href="http://www.lowrisc.org">lowRISC</a>. If you're  not able to make it, keep an eye on the lowRISC blog which I intend to keep  updating semi-live with notes from the talks and presentations.</p>  <p>The canonical home for this issue <a href="http://llvmweekly.org/issue/78">can be found here at llvmweekly.org</a>. </p> <a name='more'></a> <h3>News and articles from around the web</h3><p>Hans Wennborg has shared the <a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/llvmdev/2015-June/087060.html">release plan for LLVM/Clang  3.7</a>. This  would see the release branch created on 14th July, with a final release  targeted for 21st August.</p><p>A <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/cerberus/notes50-2015-05-24-survey-discussion.html">detailed  analysis</a>  of the results of the "What is C in practice" survey has now been posted. The  survey gained around 300 responses, and aims to help guide the definition of a  formal model for the de facto standard of C (i.e. C as it is used rather than  purely as specified in the ISO standard).</p><p>The 3.6.2-rc1 LLVM/Clang release <a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/llvmdev/2015-June/087111.html">has been  tagged</a>. As  always, testing is encouraged.</p><h3>On the mailing lists</h3><p>Unfortunately at the time of writing GMANE seems to be having some problems,  so for this week I'll be using links to the pipermail archives of the relevant  mailing list posts.</p><ul><li><p>Adrian Prantl has a proposal for <a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/llvmdev/2015-June/087109.html">improving the quality of debug locations  and of  DbgValueHistoryCalculator</a>. This will involve adding new heuristics so DbgValueHistoryCalculator is  smarter at creating ranges.</p></li><li><p>Sanjoy Patel kicked off a discussion about <a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/llvmdev/2015-June/087225.html">conversion between bitwise AND  and short-circuit evaluation for  booleans</a>. In particularly, he's wanting to ensure that short circuit evaluation is not  used (though as is pointed out in the thread, the benefit of saving the branch  is highly microarchitecture dependent).</p></li><li><p>Dan Liew has posted an RFC on <a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/llvmdev/2015-June/087246.html">improving the testing of exported LLVM CMake  targets</a>. He  has produced a <a href="https://github.com/delcypher/llvmCMakeImportDemo">toy project</a>  making use of these targets, which could be used to help ensure they stay in  working shape.</p></li><li><p>Bjarke Roune is proposing <a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/llvmdev/2015-June/087234.html">functionality to determine when a posion value is  guaranteed to produce undefined  behaviour</a>,  with the aim of improving handling of nsw/inbounds and similar in LLVM passes  such as scalar evolution.</p></li><li><p>Philip Reames has responded to a question from Chandler Carruth with a good  summary of the <a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/llvmdev/2015-June/087222.html">motivation for supporting inlining through statepoints and  patchpoints</a>.</p></li></ul><h3>LLVM commits</h3><ul><li><p>The InterleavedAccess pass has been introduced to identify interleaved  memory accesses so they can be transformed into target-specific intrinsics. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL240751">r240751</a>.</p></li><li><p>Initial serialisation of machine instructions has been added, representing  MachineInstructions in YAML. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL240295">r240295</a>,  <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL240425">r240425</a>, and more.</p></li><li><p>The CaptureTracking pass has been optimised to improve performance on very  large basic blocks. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL240560">r240560</a>.</p></li><li><p>A parser for LLVM stackmap sections has been added and made available  through llvm-readobj. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL240860">r240860</a>.</p></li></ul><h3>Clang commits</h3><ul><li><p>The recently added nullability attributes have been extensively documented. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL240296">r240296</a>.</p></li><li><p>constexpr can now be specified in condition declarations. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL240707">r240707</a>.</p></li></ul><h3>Other project commits</h3><ul><li><p>The README for the COFF linker in LLD has been updated with new performance  numbers. It's now 3.5 seconds to self-host (was previously 5 seconds), and  this compared 7 seconds with the MSVC linker and 30 seconds with the old LLD. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL240759">r240759</a>.</p></li><li><p>The safestack TODO list in compiler-rt has been updated. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL240473">r240473</a>.</p></li><li><p>LLD gained support for thread-local storage in MachO objects. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL240454">r240454</a>.</p></li><li><p>Polly has had a meaningful improvement in compile time through enabling the  small integer optimisation of the ISL (Integer Set Library). Polybench  benchmarks on average take 20% less time to compile. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL240689">r240689</a>.</p></li></ul>
