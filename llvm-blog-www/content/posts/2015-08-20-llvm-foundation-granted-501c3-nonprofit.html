title: LLVM Foundation Granted 501(c)(3) Nonprofit Status
---

The LLVM Foundation is proud to announce it has been officially approved as a public charity with tax-exempt status under Section 501(c)(3) of the United States Internal Revenue Code. Contributions donated to the LLVM Foundation are fully tax deductible, retroactive to the organization establishment date of May 5, 2014.<br /><br />The LLVM Foundation's primary mission is to provide accessible and informative educational tools for the LLVM Project and compiler technology to the general public. These educational tools include events such as the annual LLVM Developers' meeting. The LLVM Foundation also gives grants or scholarships to other nonprofit organizations and individuals (such as student travel to LLVM Foundation events). Lastly, the LLVM Foundation funds the infrastructure necessary to support the LLVM Project.<br /><br />We hope to begin accepting donations online before the end of the year. &nbsp;If you are interested in contributing, please contact your employer: they may be willing to match contributions to a 501(c)(3) charity.<br /><br />The IRS letter granting the LLVM Foundation 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status is available upon request until we can get it posted online. Please contact Tanya Lattner (tanyalattner@llvm.org), President of the LLVM Foundation.           <br /><br />
