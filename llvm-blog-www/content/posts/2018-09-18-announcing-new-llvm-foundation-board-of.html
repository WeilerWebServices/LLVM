<p>The <a href="http://llvm.org/foundation/">LLVM Foundation</a> is pleased to announce its new Board of Directors:</p> <br>Chandler Carruth <br>Mike Edwards (Treasurer) <br>Hal Finkel <br>Arnaud de Grandmaison <br>Anton Korobeynikov <br>Tanya Lattner (President) <br>Chris Lattner <br>John Regehr (Secretary) <br>Tom Stellard  <p>Two new members and seven continuing members were elected to the nine person board. </p> <p>We want to thank David Kipping for his 2 terms on the board. David has been actively involved with the LLVM Developer Meetings and was the treasurer for the past 4 years. The treasurer is a time demanding position in that he supports the day to day operation of the foundation, balancing the books, and generates monthly treasurer reports. </p> <p>We also want to thank all the applicants to the board. When voting on new board members, we took into consideration all contributions (past and present) and current involvement in the LLVM community. We also tried to create a balanced board of individuals from a wide range of backgrounds and locations to provide a voice to as many groups within the LLVM community. Given this criteria and strong applicants, we increased the board from 8 members to 9.</p> <p>About the board of directors (listed alphabetically by last name):</p> <br><b>Chandler Carruth:</b><p>Chandler Carruth has been an active contributor to LLVM since 2007. Over the years, he has has worked on LLVM’s memory model and atomics, Clang’s C++ support, GCC-compatible driver, initial profile-aware code layout optimization pass, pass manager, IPO infrastructure, and much more. He is the current code owner of inlining and SSA formation.</p> <p>In addition to his numerous technical contributions, Chandler has led Google’s LLVM efforts since 2010 and shepherded a number of new efforts that have positively and significantly impacted the LLVM project. These new efforts include things such as adding C++ modules to Clang, adding address and other sanitizers to Clang/LLVM, making Clang compatible with MSVC and available to the Windows C++ developer community, and much more. </p><p>Chandler works at Google Inc. as a technical lead for their C++ developer platform and has served on the LLVM Foundation board of directors for the last 4 years. </p> <b>Mike Edwards:</b><p>Mike Edwards is a relative newcomer to the LLVM community, beginning his involvement just a few years ago while working for Sony Playstation.  Finding the LLVM community to be an incredibly amazing and welcoming group of people, Mike knew he had to find a way to contribute.  Mike’s previous work in DevOps led him to get involved in helping to work on the llvm.org infrastructure.  Last year, with the help of the Board and several community members, Mike was able to get the llvm.org infrastructure moved onto a modern compute platform at Amazon Web Services.  Mike is one of the maintainers of our llvm.org infrastructure.  </p><p>Mike is currently working as a Software Engineer at Apple, Inc. working on the Continuous Integration and Quality Engineering efforts for LLVM and Clang development. </p> <b>Hal Finkel:</b><p>Hal Finkel has been an active contributor to the LLVM project since 2011. He is the code owner for the PowerPC target, the alias-analysis infrastructure, and other components.   </p><p>In addition to his numerous technical contributions, Hal has chaired the LLVM in HPC workshop, which is held in conjunction with Super Computing (SC), for the last five years. This workshop provides a venue for the presentation of peer-reviewed HPC-related researching LLVM from both industry and academia. He has also been involved in organizing an LLVM-themed BoF session at SC and LLVM socials in Austin. </p><p>Hal is Lead for Compiler Technology and Programming Languages at Argonne National Laboratory’s Leadership Computing Facility. </p>   <b>Arnaud de Grandmaison:</b><p>Arnaud de Grandmaison has been hacking on LLVM projects since 2008. In addition to his open source contributions, he has worked for many years on private out-of-tree LLVM-based projects at Parrot, DiBcom, or Arm. He has also been a leader in the European LLVM community by organizing the EuroLLVM Developers’ meeting, Paris socials, and chaired or participated in numerous program committees for the LLVM Developers’ Meetings and other LLVM related conferences. </p><p>Arnaud has attended numerous LLVM Developers’ meetings and volunteered as moderator or presented as well. He also moderates several LLVM mailing lists.  Arnaud is also very involved in community wide discussions and decisions such as re-licensing and code of conduct. </p><p>Arnaud is a Senior Principal Engineer at Arm. </p> <b>Anton Korobeynikov:</b><p>Anton Korobeynikov has been an active contributor to the LLVM project since 2006. Over the years, he has numerous technical contributions to areas including Windows support, ELF features, debug info, exception handling, and backends such as ARM and x86. He was the original author of the MSP430 and original System Z backend.  </p><p>In addition to his technical contributions, Anton has maintained LLVM’s participation in Google Summer of Code by managing applications, deadlines, and overall organization. He also supports the LLVM infrastructure and has been on numerous program committees for the LLVM Developers’ Meetings (both US and EuroLLVM).  </p><p>Anton is currently an associate professor at the Saint Petersburg State University and has served on the LLVM Foundation board of directors for the last 4 years.  </p> <b>Tanya Lattner:</b><p>Tanya Lattner has been involved in the LLVM project for over 14 years. She began as a graduate student who wrote her master's thesis using LLVM, and continued on using and extending LLVM technologies at various jobs during her career as a compiler engineer.    </p><p>Tanya has been organizing the US LLVM Developers’ meeting since 2008 and attended every developer meeting. She was the LLVM release manager for 3 years, moderates the LLVM mailing lists, and helps administer the LLVM infrastructure servers, mailing lists, bugzilla, etc. Tanya has also been on the program committee for the US LLVM Developers’ meeting (4+ years) and the EuroLLVM Developers’ Meeting.  </p><p>With the support of the initial board of directors, Tanya created the LLVM Foundation, defined its charitable and education mission, and worked to get 501(c)(3) status.  </p><p>Tanya is the Chief Operating Officer and has served as the President of the LLVM Foundation board for the last 4 years. </p> <b>Chris Lattner:</b><p>Chris Lattner is well known as the founder for the LLVM project and has a lengthy history of technical contributions to the project over the years.  He drove much of the early implementation, architecture, and design of LLVM and Clang. </p><p>Chris has attended every LLVM Developers’ meeting, and presented at many of them. He helped drive the conception and incorporation of the LLVM Foundation, and has served as its secretary.  Chris also grants commit access to the LLVM Project, moderates mailing lists, moderates and edits the LLVM blog, and drives important non-technical discussions and policy decisions related to the LLVM project.  </p><p>Chris manages a team building machine learning infrastructure at Google and has served on the LLVM Foundation board of directors for the last 4 years. </p> <b>John Regehr:</b><p>John Regehr has been involved in LLVM for a number of years. As a professor of computer science at the University of Utah, his research specializes in compiler correctness and undefined behavior. He is well known within the LLVM community for the hundreds of bug reports his group has reported to LLVM/Clang. </p><p>John was a project lead for IOC, a Clang based integer overflow checker that eventually became the basis for the integer parts of UBSan. He was also the primary developer of C-Reduce which utilizes Clang as a library and is often used as a test case reducer for compiler issues. </p><p>In addition to his technical contributions, John has served on several LLVM-related program committees. He also has a widely read blog about LLVM and other compiler-related issues (Embedded in Academia). </p> <b>Tom Stellard:</b><p>Tom Stellard has been contributing to the LLVM project since 2012.
