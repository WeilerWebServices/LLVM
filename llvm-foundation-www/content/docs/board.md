# Board of Directors
The Board of Directors consists of 8 members serving 2 year terms, which then
elect the next set of board members. In terms of time commitment, the board
typically meets every month for 2 hours and every board member should plan on
attending each meeting. At times a board member will take lead on a particular
issue, doing the background research needed, forming a proposal, bringing to the
Board for productive discussion and vote. Board members are expected to monitor
the board mail lists to address time critical issues or continue discussions
between board meetings. Board members should plan on attending at least EuroLLVM
or the US LLVM Developers' Meeting. In addition to the regular meeting, board
members are expected to participate with and drive efforts aligned with the
mission and three programs above. Officers of the Board (Secretary, Treasurer,
President) have additional duties and time commitments.
