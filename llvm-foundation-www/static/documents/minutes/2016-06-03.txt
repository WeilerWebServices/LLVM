Minutes
- Unanimously approved the May 10, 2016 board meeting minutes.

Relicense discussion
- Had one meeting since last board meeting, three proposals are now in flight,
  things are moving glacially.

Code of Conduct
- The draft has mostly settled, still haven't established who will be on the
  advisory board.
- Concern that we need the CoC set up before the registration for the devmtg
  opens, but that seems achievable.

Board Elections
- The term of the current board members are coming up, so the next board needs
  to be selected by then.
- Due to the nonprofit's legal structure, the current board selects the next
  board.
- We want to have some turnover in the board to bring in new faces and get
  better representation of people.
- We want the community to be able to participate, even though the board is
  required to do the selection.
- Suggestion is to have an application process, and allow anyone to apply.
  Chris and Tanya will produce a first draft and send it to the board in the
  next few weeks.
- Target the middle of July for application due date.

llvm.org server / APT
- The current plan is to move the APT server to AWS as soon as possible.
- Tanya will purchase a new smaller instance than the big one we already have.


Respectfully submitted,

Chris Lattner, Secretary
