// HACC's gravity short-range-force kernel represents the part of the 1/r^2
// gravitational force that is not computed by the long-range grid solver. This
// kernel computes the acceleration of a target particle from all of the other
// particles in the provided interaction lists. It is assumed that the target
// particle has unit mass while the interaction-list can contain pseudo
// particles with larger mass values. Beyond a distance of MaxSep, the
// inter-particle force should be completely accounted for by the long-range
// grid solver (and thus we filter out such interactions here). Closer than
// MaxSep, we directly compute the inter-particle force, subtracting the
// long-range part of the force (as fit to a polynomial of the specified
// degree). A softening length, SofteningLen, is also used, as is standard in
// N-body codes.

// For the test suite: Clang does not report a high-enough version of OpenMP

// of whether OpenMP is enabled (even if Clang's reported version were high
// enough), so we also use the Clang loop pragma to assume vectorization safety.
