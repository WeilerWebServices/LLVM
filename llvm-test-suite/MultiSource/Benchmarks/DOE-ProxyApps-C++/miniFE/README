MiniFE is an proxy application for unstructured implicit 
finite element codes. It is similar to HPCCG and pHPCCG 
but provides a much more complete vertical covering of the 
steps in this class of applications. MiniFE also provides 
support for computation on multicore nodes, including 
pthreads and Intel Threading Building Blocks (TBB) for 
homogeneous multicore and CUDA for GPUs.

This is a serial build for the LLVM test-suite.
