<div class="www_sectiontitle">Projects built with LLVM</div>

<div class="www_text">

<p>This page is an incomplete list of the projects built with LLVM, sorted in
   reverse chronological order.  The idea of this list is to show some of the
   things that have been done with LLVM for various course projects or for other
   purposes, which can be used as a source of ideas for future projects.
   Another good place to look is the list of <a href="../pubs">published papers
   and theses that use LLVM</a>.</p>

<p>Note that this page is not intended to reflect that current state of LLVM or
   show endorsement of any particular project over another.  This is just a
   showcase of the hard work various people have done.  It also shows a bit
   about how the capabilities of LLVM have evolved over time.</p>

<p>We are always looking for new contributions to this page.  If you work on a
   project that uses LLVM for a course or a publication, we would definitely
   like to hear about it, and would like to include your work here as well.
   Please just send email to <a href="mailto:llvm-dev@lists.llvm.org">the LLVM-dev
   mailing list</a> with an entry like those below.  We're not particularly
   looking for source code (though we welcome source-code contributions through
   the normal channels), but instead would like to put up the "polished results"
   of your work, including reports, papers, presentations, posters, or anything
   else you have.</p>

  Directive-based programming models, such as OpenACC and OpenMP arise today as
  promising techniques to support the development of parallel applications.
  These systems allow developers to convert a sequential program into a parallel
  one with minimum human intervention. However, inserting pragmas into
  production code is a difficult and error-prone task, often requiring
  familiarity with the target program. This difficulty restricts the ability of
  developers to annotate code that they have not written themselves. This paper
  provides one fundamental component in the solution of this problem. We
  introduce a static program analysis that infers the bounds of memory regions
  referenced in source code. Such bounds allow us to automatically insert
  data-transfer primitives, which are needed when the parallelized code is meant
  to be executed in an accelerator device, such as a GPU. To validate our ideas,
  we have applied them onto Polybench, using two different architectures: Nvidia
  and Qualcomm-based. We have successfully analyzed 98% of all the memory
  accesses in Polybench. This result has enabled us to insert automatic
  annotations into those benchmarks leading to speedups of over 100x.

<div class="www_text">
  <p>
  <a href="http://terralang.org/">Terra</a> is a system programming language that is
  embedded in and meta-programmed by Lua, which handles details like
  conditional compilation, type systems, namespaces, and
  templating/function specialization that are normally special
  constructs in other languages. Terra code shares Lua's syntax and
  control-flow constructs, and it can easily call Lua functions and vice
  versa. Since the JIT compiler is available at runtime, libraries and
  embedded domain specific languages can use it to dynamically generate
  or auto-tune arbitrary high performance code with custom
  optimizations.
  </p>

  <p>
  Terra is backwards compatible with (and embeddable in) existing C code
  and is likewise a small, monomorphic, statically-typed, compiled
  language with manual memory management. There is also built-in support
  for SIMD operations and other low-level features like non-temporal
  writes and prefetches. Terra can optionally run independently from
  LuaJIT and LLVM. In fact, if your final program doesnâ€™t need Lua, you
  can save Terra code into an object file, shared library, or
  executable.

<p>In this project, we have shown that register allocation can be viewed as

   board and the program variables as puzzle pieces; pre-coloring and register
   aliasing fit in naturally.  For architectures such as x86, SPARC V8, and
   StrongARM, we can solve the puzzles in polynomial time, and we have augmented
   the puzzle solver with a simple heuristic for spilling.  For SPEC CPU2000,
   our implementation is as fast as the extended version of linear scan used by

<p><a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~babic/index_calysto.htm">Calysto</a> is a
   scalable context- and path-sensitive SSA-based static assertion
   checker. Unlike other static checkers, Calysto analyzes SSA directly, which
   means that it not only checks the original code, but also the front-end
   (including SSA-optimizations) of the compiler which was used to compile the
   code. The advantage of doing static checking on the SSA is language
   independency and the fact that the checked code is much closer to the

<p>Several main factors contribute to Calysto's scalability:
   <ul>
     <li> A novel SSA symbolic execution algorithm that exploits the

  <a name="ssa_ra">Improvements on SSA-Based Register Allocation.</a>
</div>

<div class="www_subsubsection">
By Fernando Pereira, UCLA.
</div>

<div class="www_text">

<p>The register allocation problem has an exact polynomial solution when
   restricted to programs in the Single Static Assignment (SSA) form.  Although
   striking, this major theoretical accomplishment has yet to be endorsed
   empirically.  This project consists in the implementation of a complete
   SSA-based register allocator using the <a href="http://llvm.org/"
   target="blank">LLVM</a> compiler framework.  We have implemented a static
   transformation of the target program that simplifies the implementation of
   the register allocator and improves the quality of the code that it
   generates.  We also describe novel techniques to perform register coalescing
   and SSA-elimination.  In order to validate our allocation technique, we
   extensively compare different flavors of our method against a modern and
   heavily tuned extension of the linear-scan register allocator described
   <a href="2004-Fall-CS426-LS.pdf">here</a>.  The proposed algorithm
   consistently produces faster code when the target architecture provides a
   small number of registers.  For instance, we have achieved an average
   speed-up of 9.2% when limiting the number of registers to four general

<p>The <a href="http://www.cs.ucsd.edu/~mmccrack/lens/">LENS Project</a> is
   intended to improve the task of measuring programs and investigating their
   behavior.  LENS defines an external representation of a program in XML to
   store useful information that is accessible based on program structure,
   including loop structure information.</p>

<p>Lens defines a flexible naming scheme for program components based on XPath
   and the LENS XML document structure. This allows users and tools to
   selectively query program behavior from a uniform interface, allowing users
   or tools to ask a variety of questions about program components, which can be
   answered by any tool that understands the query. Queries, metrics and program
   structure are all stored in the LENS file, and are annotated with version
   names that support historical comparison and scientific record-keeping.</p>

<p>Compiler writers can use LENS to expose results of transformations and
   analyses for a program easily, without worrying about display or handling
   information overload. This functionality has been demonstrated using
   LLVM. LENS uses LLVM for two purposes: first, to generate the initial program
   structure file in XML using an LLVM pass, and second, as a demonstration of
   the advantages of selective querying for compiler information, with an
   interface built into LLVM that allows LLVM passes to easily respond to
   queries in a LENS file.</p>

<p>The LLVM Visualization Tool (LLVM-TV) can be used to visualize the effects of
   transformations written in the LLVM framework.  Our visualizations reflect
   the state of a compilation unit at a single instant in time, between
   transformations; we call these saved states "snapshots".  A user can
   visualize a sequence of snapshots of the same module&mdash;for example, as a
   program is being optimized&mdash;or snapshots of different modules, for
   comparison purposes.</p>

<p>Our target audience consists of developers working within the LLVM framework,
   who are trying to understand the LLVM representation and its analyses and
   transformations.  In addition, LLVM-TV has been designed to make it easy to
   add new kinds of program visualization modules.  LLVM-TV is based on

<p>Traditional architectures use the hardware instruction set for dual purposes:
   first, as a language in which to express the semantics of software programs,
   and second, as a means for controlling the hardware. The thesis of
   the <a href="/pubs/2003-10-01-LLVA.html">Low-Level Virtual Architecture</a>
   project is to decouple these two uses from one another, allowing software to
   be expressed in a semantically richer, more easily-manipulated format, and
   allowing for more powerful optimizations and whole-program analyses directly
   on compiled code.</p>

<p>The semantically rich format we use in LLVA, which is based on the LLVM
   compiler infrastructure's intermediate representation, can best be understood
   as a "virtual instruction set". This means that while its instructions are
   closely matched to those available in the underlying hardware, they may not
   correspond exactly to the instructions understood by the underlying hardware.
   These underlying instructions we call the "implementation instruction set."
   Between the two layers lives the translation layer, typically implemented in
   software.</p>

<p>In this project, we have taken our next logical steps in this effort by (1)
   porting the entire Linux kernel to LLVA, and (2) engineering an environment
   in which a kernel can be run directly from its LLVM bytecode representation
   &mdash; essentially, a minimal, but complete, emulated computer system with
   LLVA as its native instruction set. The emulator we have invented, llva-emu,
   executes kernel code by translating programs "just-in-time" from the LLVM
   bytecode format to the processor's native instruction set.</p>

<p>As every modern computer user has experienced, software updates and upgrades
   frequently require programs and sometimes the entire operating system to be
   restarted. This can be a painful and annoying experience. What if this common
   annoyance could be avoided completely or at least significantly reduced?
   Imagine only rebooting your system when you wanted to shut your computer down
   or only closing an application when you wanted rather than when an update
   occurs.  The purpose of this project is to investigate the potential of
   performing dynamic patching of executables and create a patching tool capable
   of automatically generating patches and applying them to applications that
   are already running. This project should answer questions like: How can
   dynamic updating be performed? What type of analysis is required? Can this
   analysis be effectively automated? What can be updated in the running
   executable (e.g., algorithms, organization, data, etc.)?</p>

   traditional PRE implementations because it relies on useful properties of
   Static Single-Assignment (SSA) form to perform dataflow analysis in a much

<p>We present the design and implementation of Jello, a <i>retargetable</i>
   Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler for the Intel IA32 architecture.  The input to
   Jello is a C program statically compiled to Low-Level Virtual Machine (LLVM)
   bytecode.  Jello takes advantage of the features of the LLVM bytecode
   representation to permit efficient run-time code generation, while
   emphasizing retargetability.  Our approach uses an abstract machine code
   representation in Static Single Assignment form that is machine-independent,
   but can handle machine-specific features such as implicit and explicit
   register references.  Because this representation is target-independent, many
   phases of code generation can be target-independent, making the JIT easily
   retargetable to new platforms without changing the code generator.  Jello's
   ultimate goal is to provide a flexible host for future research in runtime
   optimization for programs written in languages which are traditionally
   compiled statically.</p>

<p>Note that Jello eventually evolved into the current LLVM JIT, which is part

<p><a href="http://www4.cs.fau.de/Research/RTSC/">The Real-Time Systems Compiler
   (RTSC)</a> is an operating-systemâ€“aware compiler that allows for a generic
   manipulation of the real-time system architecture of a given real-time
   application.</p>

<p>Currently, its most interesting application is the automatic migration of an
   event-triggered (i.e. based on OSEK OS) system to a time-triggered
   (i.e. based on OSEKTime) one. To achieve this, the RTSC derives an abstract
   global dependency graph from the source code of the application formed by so
   called "Atomic Basic Blocks" (ABBs). This "ABB-graph" is free of any
   dependency to the original operating system but includes all control and data
   dependencies of the application. Thus this graph can be mapped to another
   target operating system. Currently input applications can be written for OSEK
   OS and then be migrated to OSEKTime or POSIX systems.</p>

<p>The LLVM-framework is used throughout the whole process. At first the static
   analysis of the application needed to construct the ABB-graph is performed
   using the LLVM-framework. Additionally the manipulation and final generation
   of the target system are also based on the LLVM.</p>
