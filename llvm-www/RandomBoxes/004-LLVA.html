The <a href="pubs/2003-10-01-LLVA.html">LLVA</a> project is looking at novel 
microprocessor designs by exploiting the LLVM code representation as the 
<b>native</b> interface from software to the processor.  This style of processor
implementation allows the architects to freely change the ISA of the processor and
exposes key high-level information to it as well.
