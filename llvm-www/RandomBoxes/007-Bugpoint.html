<a href="docs/Bugpoint.html">Bugpoint</a> is an automated testcase reduction
tool that is extremely useful for debugging problems in LLVM optimizers and code
generators.  It can usually reduce an optimizer crash down to the few
instructions needed to reproduce the problem or a miscompilation down to the
specific loop nest or basic block in the program that is being miscompiled.
