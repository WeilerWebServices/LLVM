LLVM includes a powerful <a href="docs/AliasAnalysis.html">Alias analysis 
infrastructure</a> that makes it easy to experiment with implementations
of new alias analysis algorithms and compare the results against standard
algorithms.  LLVM also includes several alias-analysis-driven optimizations
so that you can see how the precision of your analysis affects the actual 
execution time of the program.
