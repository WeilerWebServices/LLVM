LLVM includes a powerful Just-In-Time compilation system.  You can even 
dynamically generate portable LLVM code on the fly and dynamically compile 
it to native code, without having to go to LLVM bytecode or assembly.  
Consider a raytracer with a programmable shading model: JIT compilation 
can speed up shader evaluation by orders of magnitude over interpretation.
