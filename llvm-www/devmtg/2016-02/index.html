<div class="www_sectiontitle" id="what">What is it?</div>
<p>
<a href="http://bloomberg.com/company/technology" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a> is hosting a gathering of developers, students, and others from around
the Clang/LLVM community to spend a weekend learning how to work on Clang, LLVM, and other projects in the LLVM ecosystem. This event is intended to help
new community members get started learning how to contribute, how to work on the code, and get their first patches written and submitted.
</p>
<p>
Bloomberg is providing the space, food, beverages, travel/lodging for mentors, and the organization of the event, so attendees only need to bring their 
laptops (with power adapters!) and a willingness to learn and contribute. At both locations there will be experienced mentors on hand to provide guidance.
</p>

<p>
The Google Group (mailing list) <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/clang-llvm-sprint-2016-bloomberg">clang-llvm-sprint-2016-bloomberg@googlegroups.com</a>
can be used to discuss issues of general interest related to the weekend.
</p>
<p>
Kevin Fleming and Henry Kleynhans are organizing this event, in New York and London, respectively. They can be contacted through the mailing list or via the EventBrite
pages (linked below).
</p>
<div class="www_subsection">IRC and Social Media</div>
<p>Attendees at this event, and anyone else who wants to chat with them, should use channel <b>#bbgweekend</b> on irc.oftc.net.</p>
<p>If you want to talk about this event on Twitter, please tag TechAtBloomberg (@techatbloomberg).</p>
<div class="www_subsection">Project Planning and Tracking</div>
<p>The event is using a Trello board to track projects and the teams that are working on them. The board can be found
<a href="https://trello.com/b/zF3DqT7G/clang-llvm-sprint-weekend-feb-6-7-2016">here</a>.</p>
<div class="www_subsection">Getting Started Quickly with a Virtual Machine</div>
<p>A virtual machine image is available, based on Ubuntu Linux 14.04, that you can use to get your laptop ready for the event quickly. You'll need a virtualization
package (hypervisor); the image was created using VirtualBox 5, but has been tested with VMware and other hypervisors. Since it is a generic image, when you import
it you'll need to ensure that you supply the VM with adequate CPU and memory resources; while you can build LLVM with only one CPU and 4GB of memory, it will be slow
enough to be inconvenient.</p>

<p>New York event attendees should download the image <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/bbg-misc-us/llvm_1.ova" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>London event attendees should download the image <a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bbg-misc-eu/llvm_1.ova" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>When you boot the image into a machine, you can log in with user 'llvm', password 'llvm'. As is typical with Ubuntu systems, this user has sudo privileges, so you
can install additional software or make configuration changes.</p>

<p>Note: if you use VMware to load this image, you may receive a warning about the image being non-compliant with the Open Virtualization specification; allow the
import to proceed anyway, and you'll have a working VM.</p>

<p>
Civic Hall is located at the intersection of 20th Street and Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. You'll enter through the <a href="civichallentrance.jpg" target="_blank">main entrance</a> on Fifth Avenue, then take either
the stairs (on your left) or the elevator bank (labeled East Elevators) on your right, to the second floor. If you have any questions or need assistance, the
security guard just inside the lobby will be happy to help you.
</p>
<p>
When you arrive at the second floor, there will be a check-in desk, so please stop there to ensure that we know you've arrived. You'll then be directed to the
<a href="civichallhackspace.jpg" target="_blank">hacking space</a>, where you can find a place to setup your laptop, and then head over to the kitchen to grab breakfast, coffee, juice, etc.
</p>
<p>
Note: If you arrive after 11AM, the check-in desk will no longer be present, so just enter through the main door to Civic Hall from the second floor landing, and check in
at the main Civic Hall reception counter.
</p>
<p>
On both days, breakfast and lunch will be provided; on Saturday, dinner will also be provided. Please review the <a href="newyorkmenu.html">menu</a> in advance, and if for any reason the options available
will not meet your requirements, let us know, but be prepared to make alternate arrangements for meals. There are a large number of places to obtain food (from delis to
sandwich shops to sit-down restaurants) in the area around Civic Hall, so you should be able to find something compatible.
