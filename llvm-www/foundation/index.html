<p>
The LLVM Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit whose mission is to support education and advancement of the field of compilers and tools through educational events, grants and scholarships, and increasing diversity with the field of compilers, tools, and the LLVM project. We have established 3 main programs: Educational Outreach, Grants & Scholarships, and Women in Compilers & Tools.</p>

<p>The Educational Outreach program is our largest program and includes educational materials and events related to the LLVM Project, compiler technology, and tools. Our 2 largest events are the LLVM Developers’ meetings located in the San Francisco Bay Area, and in Europe. These meetings serve as a forum for LLVM project developers, users, and academic researchers to get acquainted, learn how LLVM is used, and exchange ideas about LLVM and compiler technology. This program also includes educational materials such as instructional videos and full video recordings from our developer meetings that are available free to anyone.</p>

<p>The LLVM project is becoming one of the top platforms of choice for compiler research at universities. The Grants & Scholarships program is designed to support student presenter travel to the LLVM Developers’ Meetings and other conferences that students may attend and present their LLVM and compiler related work.</p>

<p>Lastly, our Women in Compilers & Tools program aims to increase female participation in the LLVM Project and the field of compilers and tools. We hope to achieve this by increasing awareness of the LLVM project at various technical conferences with strong female participation, established a mentor program, and lower barriers of entry for this field.</p>

<div class="www_sectiontitle">Board of Directors</div>
<p>
The Board of Directors consists of 9 members serving 2 year terms, which then elect the next set of board members. In terms of time commitment, the board typically meets every month for 2 hours and every board member should plan on attending each meeting. At times a board member will take lead on a particular issue, doing the background research needed, forming a proposal, bringing to the Board for productive discussion and vote. Board members are expected to monitor the board mail lists to address time critical issues or continue discussions between board meetings. Board members should plan on attending at least EuroLLVM or the US LLVM Developers' Meeting. In addition to the regular meeting, board members are expected to participate with and drive efforts aligned with the mission and three programs above. Officers of the Board (Secretary, Treasurer, President) have additional duties and time commitments.
