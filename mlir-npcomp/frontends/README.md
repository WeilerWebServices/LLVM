# NPComp - Frontends

NPComp maintains in-tree frontends for various popular numeric-python based
frameworks. In general these are:

* Considered optional components
* Target dialects maintained at the top-level of the project
* Maintained in isolation so as to facilitate moving them out to dedicated
  projects at an appropriate point of the lifecycle (i.e. if NPComp is
  successful as a general purpose target for such frameworks, then it may
  make sense to contribute/build each frontend to their respective up-stream
  project).

Frontends try to stylistically fit into the outer project except for when it
is more clear/advantageous to align them with the conventions of the source
project. This is approached on a case by case basis as needed. Deviations
should be documented in a local style guide for the frontend.
